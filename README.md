Inventory Management System

Created a Inventory Management System which is able to create, read, update and delete information which is inputed within the system. We created a MySQL database that synced with Java Eclipse which allowed the database to be retrieved from MySQL
Getting Started
Firstly create a sql instance on google cloud. Then pull the code to your eclipse using gitbash. Change the ip addresses of the MySQL database within java to there own databases ip

Prerequisites
Java IDE
Mvn

Installing

Open using any  JAVA IDE and and runner the Runner class.

Change all databases connections ip within the code to there own databases ip. This are located within there classes ims and all daoMysql
Run the application by pressing ctrl and f11 simultaneously. This will then prompt you to input your username and password to your own MySql database. The list of table names will then be presented and once a table is selected a series of commands will be displayed which allow for the table to be modified. The create function allows for a new item to be saved into the database. The read function shows all the items present in the database. For example read will pull all the information from the database table and input it into the console. The update function allows a item already in the database to be changed and the delete function removes a item from the database
Running the tests
Right click the test class in Java and run it in Junit. This will return wether the code works or not by showing pass or not pass
Unit Tests
Explain what these tests test, why and how to run them
